# Calypso

Calypso is the new WordPress.com front-end – a beautiful redesign of the WordPress dashboard using a single-page web application, powered by the WordPress.com REST API. Calypso is built for reading, writing, and managing all of your WordPress sites in one place.

It’s built with JavaScript – a very light [node](https://nodejs.org) plus [express](http://expressjs.com) server, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), [wpcom.js](http://wpcomjs.com), and many other wonderful libraries on the front-end.
